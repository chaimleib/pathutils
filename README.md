# pathutils

A set of bash scripts providing useful tools to manipulate paths.

Goals:
* Cross-platform
* Simple to install

## Provided tools
These are ported to bash from the Python source for the [posixpath module](http://svn.python.org/projects/python/branches/release27-maint/Lib/posixpath.py) and have the same behavior.

* pathisabs - whether the path is an absolute path. No output; use its return status instead.
